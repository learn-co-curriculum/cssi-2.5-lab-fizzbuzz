# FizzBuzz
Fizzbuzz is the time honored example program in which you need to write a program that returns "Fizz" for numbers divided by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divided by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both.  If a number is not divisible by either, just return the number.  Now go JavaScript!
